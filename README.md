Black Mirror Prototype

This repository holds the prototype and scientific data published at the Business Information Conference 2020 with the title:

**The Black Mirror: What Your Mobile Phone Number Reveals about You.**

A link to the conference proceedings will be added here as soon as it is available.

To test the current version of the prototype, download the git repository and start from the Black_Mirror_Privacy_Checker___Home.html file.

**This is a living prototype: we are improving the klickdummy and adding functionality over time.**
Right now, the visual prototype will give tips for social network usage and demonstrate the functionality of our concept.
